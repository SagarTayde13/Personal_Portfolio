            Narayan was not like most children his age.
             While others ran around, shouted, and played noisily,
              Narayan was always calm and composed.
               He had a quiet charm about him that made everyone notice,
                even though he never tried to stand out. Whether he was in class,
                 at home, or on the playground, Narayan carried a peaceful energy wherever he went.One of the most special things about Narayan was his ability to stay calm in difficult situations. If there was a problem, Narayan didn’t panic. Instead, he would think carefully and try to find a solution. His teachers appreciated this maturity, and his classmates often came to him for advice or help. 
                 Even when someone was rude to him, he responded with kindness. This made Narayan loved and respected by all.
